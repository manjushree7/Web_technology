    <p>Mobile Legends Bang Bang is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) app for Android. In Mobile Legend Bang Gang, you can play with up to 4 other friends in a 5vs5 MOBA competition. With 10-second match-making, you won’t have to wait long for your next game. 
    Choose from the massive roster of heroes and take part in hectic 10-minute battles. The gameplay itself is similar to other MOBA games, notably League of Legends. Your overall goal is to defeat the enemy’s base by taking control of lanes, jungling, and conquering opposing heroes.  
    The game was developed and published by a subsidiary of ByteDance, called Moonton, in 2016. Since then, it has gained a huge following in Southeast Asia, going so far as to be chosen for the first medal event in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games esports competition.
